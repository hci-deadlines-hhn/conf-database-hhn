Database for conferences used by hci-deadlines-hhn website

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome!

This database includes conferences in HCI and related fields. You can refer to [conferenceranks.com](conferenceranks.com) for conference rankings and quality assessments. Please feel free to maintain a separate fork if you don't see your sub-field or conference of interest listed.

To add or update a deadline:

1. Fork the repository
2. Look inside the folder **conferences**. If the conference you want to add has a `yml` file, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, create a new file with the name of the conference. For example, if the conference name is `xyz`, then create the file `xyz.yml` inside the _conferences_ folder.
3. Open the file of the conference you want to update. Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place` attributes.
4. For the `sub` (subject) attribute, you must pick only among the following options. If you want to add a special category, open an [issue](https://github.com/hci-deadlines-hhn/conf-database-hhn/issues) and we will consider it.

   | `sub` category | Subject it corresponds to            |

   | HCI            | Human-Computer Interaction           |
   | AI+HCI         | Articial Intelligence and AI         |
   | CSCW           | Computer-supported cooperative work  |
   | DES            | Design                               |
   | HAP            | Haptics                              |
   | HRI            | Human-Robot Interaction              |
